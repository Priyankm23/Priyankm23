# 👋 Hi, I'm Priyank Moradiya

# 💫 About Me

I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech undergrad committed to **backend development** and building reliable, real-world systems.

I primarily work with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, designing RESTful APIs with databases like **MongoDB** and **MySQL** but also expanding into **Python (FastAPI)** and deepening my database skills with **SQLite** and **PostgreSQL**. I am proficient in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **C++**, and I specialize in optimizing backend logic, data flow, and system architecture. 

Currently, I’m focused on learning **Docker**, **PostgreSQL**, and **cloud deployment** to master scalability, containerization, and production environments. I also have a foundational understanding of **Generative AI** and explore its practical use in automating and enhancing backend systems.

My portfolio includes projects like a personal **Subscription Tracker** and a **Crypto Portfolio Manager** developed during my **Infosys Springboard internship**. I am actively seeking backend-focused roles where I can contribute to APIs, database design, and performance-oriented applications. **Feel free to connect or explore my work below!**

A **community-powered platform** that promotes sustainable fashion by enabling users to exchange wearable garments instead of buying new ones.

**Core Functionality**
- Item exchange via **direct swaps** or a **points-based redemption system**
- User dashboard to manage listings, swaps, and points
- Item listings with images, categories, conditions, and tags
- **Admin moderation flow** for listing approval and content control
